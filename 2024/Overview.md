**Brief description:**
**Status:**
**Notes:**

### Quest 1
**Brief description:** Calculate number of potions needed to defeat a string representing a series of enemies. Enemies initially come on their own but then get updated to attack in pairs or trios, requiring different numbers of potions.
**Status:** Completed
**Notes:** Not remotely optimised, would like to go back and solve the problem in a nicer way. Definitely some neat way to handle the different number of x's in a trio versus my dictionary lookup.

### Quest 2
**Brief description:** String matching in a string/series of strings/grid, begins with just counting the occurences of each string, ends with needing to count every letter which exists in at least 1 string in all directions (essentially doing a wordsearch)
**Status:** Semi-complete
**Notes:** Parts 1 and 2 are completed and part 3 is almost complete, finding 11393/11497 of the used letters but missing at least 1 edge case. No idea which edge case is missing though as I cannot seem to construct a test which contains the edge case.

### Quest 3
**Brief description:** Identify how big a hole you can dig where the depth cannot change by more than 1 in adjacent squares. Extends to also consider diagonal squares after.
**Status:** Completed
**Notes:** Pretty straightforward one, haven't tried to optimise but runs pretty quick. Definitely some clever algorithm you could use. Did not progress much and the changes were pretty simple to implement with the structure I had.
